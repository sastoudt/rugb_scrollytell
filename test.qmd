Got sharks? We will be looking at Great White Shark sightings reported to iNaturalist across the globe, going the whole way back to 1950.





First we'll set the scene. @cr-image_ex1









Let's go back in time. @cr-image_ex2











Time passes....
 @cr-image_ex3
 












and passes.... As it does: what do you notice about locations that have many observations? Are these "hotspots" consistent across decades?

@cr-image_ex4













Let's zoom in on Australia.
@cr-image_ex5









What's going on with that lone shark on the west coast?
[@cr-image_ex5]{pan-to="50%,50%" scale-by="2"}







**Writing Prompt**: Write from the point of view of the shark that was spotted. Why would they want to travel alone in a new location? How did they get there, and where are they coming from?

## **What to Emphasize?**

| i sing a scorched song. walking the charred ground, the palm fronds and yucca still smoking, burning their black
| hosannas into the loam. i sing of the earth, born of fire, and born again out of each burn. this is a lightning
| land, the longleaf pine country, dependent on flame, on extinguishing. not all conflagration is death and dying,
| not all hellfire. remember the flicker of the cherub’s sword protecting the garden?—this is that breath of blaze.

| {#cr-pval-wiki}
| In null-hypothesis significance testing, the p-value is the probability of obtaining test results
| at least as extreme as the result actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct.
| A very small p-value means that such an extreme observed outcome would be very unlikely under the null hypothesis.
| Even though reporting p-values of statistical tests is common practice in academic publications of many quantitative fields,
| misinterpretation and misuse of p-values is widespread and has been a major topic in mathematics and metascience.

This is the beginning of a poem inspired by St. Mark's National Wildlife Refuge called "Controlled Burn(ing) Haibun" by Chris Watkins. `https://www.thedodgemag.com/chriswatkins1`
@cr-start-wildlife



The author goes on to create two erasure poems based on this text.
[@cr-start-wildlife]{hlz="1"}





An erasure poem takes some other text and crosses out parts of it, revealing a new text.

**Your Turn**: Make an erasure poem out of the first paragraph on Wiki about p-values.
