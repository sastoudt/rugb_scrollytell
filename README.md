# rugb_scrollytell
materials for rugb scrollytell workshop

Install the closereads extension (or update it) by running the following command in the directory you wish to use it:

`quarto add qmd-lab/closeread`

Then you should be able to render [`test.qmd`](https://github.com/sastoudt/rugb_scrollytell/blob/main/test.qmd) to see the example for today.

There are some introductory slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A3UEzfv4aVzzQgYgqr5gD2mY9ovXa17uckxyI_40bUw/edit?usp=sharing).

## Writing resources

If you are a Bucknell student/faculty/staff, you have free e-book access to my book with Deborah Nolan, "Communicating with data: the art of writing for data science" [here](https://bucknell.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1261275061). I recommend checking out Chapter 6 (storyboarding and finding the story), Section 7.3.5 (captions) and Section 9.4 (narrative arc and transitions). You can also read more about the storyboarding process [here](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2025.2539997).
